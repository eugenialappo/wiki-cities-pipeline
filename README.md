This project uses R to scrape, clean, and visualize city data from Wikipedia. 
It collects information on about cities: its name, population, and area. 
As an additional task, I manually calculated the population density from the raw data instead of just taking the value directly from the table.
The cleaned data is then used to create visualizations: a bar chart and a scatter plot. 
The final, processed data is saved as a CSV file for future use and the visualisations saved as png images for furthe use.
