This project uses R to scrape, clean, and visualise city data from Wikipedia. 
It collects information on cities: their names, populations, and areas. 
As an additional task, I manually calculated the population density from the raw data instead of just taking the value directly from the table.
The cleaned data is then used to create visualisations: a bar chart and a scatter plot. 
The final, processed data is saved as a CSV file for future use, and the visualisations are saved as PNG images for further use.
